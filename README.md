This project explores the impact of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) on the performance of Free Space Optical (FSO) communication systems. By optimizing signal reflection and propagation, RIS can significantly enhance communication reliability and data throughput in smart city and next-generation wireless networks.

The study focuses on how parameters such as the number of RIS elements and Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) influence system efficiency and optical link performance.
